# Revenue Model: The Engine for the Movement

This document outlines the business model designed to financially sustain the Clarity Pledge movement. The philosophy is to separate the free, open-source movement from the professional services that fund it.

## Philosophy: Fundraising as Activism

The revenue model is framed as a funding mechanism for the social movement. This aligns the commercial activity with the core mission and reframes "sales" as "fundraising for the cause."

-   **Moral Licensing:** We are not "marketing to get rich." We are "fundraising" to support a cause we believe in. This is an internal motivator and an external pitch.
-   **Status:** This signals that the work is mission-driven, which is perceived as higher value than simple consulting.

## The Funnel: From Pledge to Patron

The decentralized structure of the movement creates a natural funnel to identify and qualify potential clients.

1.  **Top of Funnel (The Pledge):** A free, public commitment that attracts a broad audience of individuals who value clarity. This is the lead generation for the movement.
2.  **Mid-Funnel (The Founding Dojo):** An open invitation to all pledgers to join a community of practice. This space serves to deepen engagement and, crucially, to identify individuals and leaders with high-stakes clarity problems. It is the qualification stage.
3.  **Bottom of Funnel (The Offer):** A direct, high-value offer made to qualified individuals from the Dojo who require professional intervention for a specific, costly problem.

## The Core Offer: "The Cognitive Clarity Audit"

This is the primary "product" sold to fund the movement. It is a tangible deliverable, not an abstract coaching process.

-   **The Pitch:** "I don't have the answers. My role is not to be a teacher, but to provide a rigorous process to stress-test your own thinking. I am a thinking partner."
-   **The Price:** **$400 USD (Flat Fee for Beta)**
-   **The Process:**
    1.  **Pre-Work:** The client fills out a rigorous questionnaire to ensure commitment and provide context.
    2.  **The Session:** A 75-minute deep-dive session to "stress-test" the logic around their primary bottleneck.
    3.  **The Artifact:** A 2-3 page "Decision Architecture" PDF delivered within 24 hours, summarizing the bottleneck, options, and hidden risks.

### The Beta Test Pitch Script

> "I'm formalizing my consulting process into a new product called the 'Cognitive Audit.' It’s designed to find logic gaps in business strategy.
>
> I need to run 3 beta tests to refine the documentation. I’d like to do one with you.
>
> **Protocol:**
> 1. We do a 75-min deep dive on your current biggest bottleneck.
> 2. I send you a strategic map (PDF) within 24 hours.
>
> Since this is a beta test, there is **no upfront fee**. At the end, if the insight was valuable to you, you can contribute whatever you think it was worth to my project runway. If it wasn't useful, you owe nothing.
>
> Up for being a guinea pig?"

## The Retainer: Ongoing Clarity Maintenance

The audit is designed to lead to a recurring revenue relationship.

-   **The Insight:** Clarity is not a permanent state; it decays. The audit finds the "bug," but the retainer provides the ongoing "patches."
-   **The Offer:** A recurring engagement for "Executive Sounding Boarding" or "Logic Stress-Testing."
-   **The Goal:** Secure 2-3 retainer clients from the initial audits to create a stable, predictable funding base for the movement.
