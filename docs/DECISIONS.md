## 2026-01-17: P66 - Live meeting hosting requires authentication

**Context:** Anyone could start a Clarity Live meeting without an account. We wanted accountability and quality by requiring registration.

**Decision:** Gate meeting hosting behind auth, but keep joining open:
- Guests on `/live` → redirected to `/signup`
- Guests on `/live/CODE` → can join (invited participants don't need accounts)
- Logged-in users → can host meetings
- Non-pledged users (has_pledged=false) CAN host — they're still verified users

**Alternatives rejected:**
- Require pledge to host — too restrictive; many users want to try meetings before committing to pledge
- Show different page content based on auth — adds complexity; redirect is simpler
- Auto-redirect back to `/live` after signup — KISS principle; user can navigate via nav

**Consequences:**
- Analytics event stays `try_meeting` (renaming breaks historical data)
- Button text changed from "Try a Clarity Meeting" → "Start a Clarity Meeting" to match gated UX
- P66.1 added page-load redirect (not just button-click gate)

## 2026-01-17: Knowledge-Driven Development (KDD) adoption

**Context:** Documentation goes stale immediately. Feature docs are written once during planning but never updated after implementation. Trade-offs and "why" decisions are lost to git commit history where they're hard to find.

**Decision:** Adopt a minimal knowledge capture system:
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` (this file) - append-only log of trade-offs and reasoning
- `/kdd` skill - manual command to capture decisions when they matter
- `features/archive/` - where completed feature docs go after merge

**Alternatives rejected:**
- CHANGELOG.md - Git log already tracks changes; we need "why" not "what"
- ARCHITECTURE.md - CLAUDE.md already covers this
- Pre-merge hooks - Too much friction; manual discipline is enough
- Auto-archival with pattern matching - Fragile and over-engineered

**Consequences:**
- Run `/kdd` after finishing features with interesting trade-offs
- Move feature docs to `features/archive/` manually after merge
- This file grows indefinitely (append-only) - newest at top for easy reading
