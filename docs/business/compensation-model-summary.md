# Co-Founder Compensation Model

**Model:** Profit Participation
**Structure:** Estonian OÜ
**Philosophy:** Power with people, not power over people

---

## The Intention

### The Problem We're Solving

The standard startup compensation model is broken for most participants:

- Early team members hold options that vest over 4 years for an exit that takes 10
- Everyone waits for a liquidity event that statistically never comes (90% of startups fail; of the 10% that survive, most never exit)
- Paper wealth that never converts to real money

The equity model optimizes for *one big payout someday*. It creates misaligned incentives: growth-at-all-costs, runway extension theater, and deferred compensation that rarely materializes.

### What We Do Instead

We build a **profitable business** where contributors get paid when the business makes money—not when it sells to someone else.

Our model is simple:
- **Track contributions** using a transparent points system
- **Share profits** quarterly once we're profitable
- **Keep the code open-source** so anyone can fork if the business is mismanaged

This is "power with people" not "power over people." We're building a system where:
- The math is visible to everyone
- The financials are shared quarterly
- The escape hatch (fork the code) is always unlocked

### The Core Bet

If you join this model, you're betting:
- The product will become profitable (not just fundable)
- The business will be run honestly (and you can verify via shared P&L)
- Quarterly cash is worth more to you than lottery-ticket equity

If that bet doesn't work for you, no hard feelings. This model isn't for everyone—it's for people who've seen the traditional model fail and want something different.

## How It Works

### Points System

Contributions are tracked in a shared spreadsheet (the "Contribution Ledger") visible to all participants.

**Time contributions:** Hours × 2x multiplier
- 10 hours of approved work → 20 points
- Equivalent rate: €50/hour (for calculation purposes)

**Cash contributions:** Amount × 4x multiplier
- €1,000 invested → 4,000 points

**Commitment tier (optional):** 2.5x multiplier for sustained contributors (20+ hrs/week for 6+ months)

### Profit Pool

**40% of Surplus Profit** is distributed to point holders.

Surplus Profit = Net Profit − Operating Expenses − Taxes − Reinvestment Reserve

**Reinvestment Reserve formula:**
Lower of: 20% of trailing 12-month revenue OR €50,000

This ensures the business maintains runway while capping how much can be held back from distribution.

### Distribution Schedule

- **Quarterly** distributions (March, June, September, December)
- **Minimum €1,000 balance** before payout
- **Payment fees** deducted from recipient's payout

### Example Contribution Ledger

| Contributor | Source | Points | % of Pool |
|-------------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Founder | Founder's Grant | 2,000 | — |
| Founder | Time (500 hrs × 2x) | 1,000 | — |
| **Founder Total** | — | **3,000** | **60%** |
| Co-founder A | Time (250 hrs × 2x) | 500 | 10% |
| Co-founder B | Time (200 hrs × 2x) + Cash (€1k × 4x) | 1,500 | 30% |
| **Total** | — | **5,000** | **100%** |

All contributions—including the Founder's Grant—are visible in the shared ledger.

## Protections for Contributors

### Transparency Commitments
- Quarterly P&L shared with all participants
- Contribution Ledger always accessible (view and comment)
- 30 days notice before any agreement changes

### Open Source Fork Rights
The code is open-source. If you believe the business is mismanaged:
- Fork the code
- Build a competing product
- Your protection is exit, not board control

See [Why Transparency Matters](./why-transparency-matters.md) for more on why we built accountability into a limited liability structure.

### Trial Period
First 3 months: either party can exit with 7 days notice, points paid at 50% value.

### Pause Mechanism
Up to 6 months contribution pause (with written notice) without point forfeiture. One pause per 24-month period.

---

## Exit Scenarios

### Voluntary Exit
- 30 days notice required
- Payout at next scheduled quarterly distribution
- OR company may offer immediate buyout at 90% of balance value

### Business Acquisition
- Points convert to cash from transaction proceeds
- Conversion rate defined in agreement
- Paid before founder distribution

### Inactivity (12+ months without contributions)
- Points forfeit unless pause was approved in advance
- Can re-join under new agreement

## Common Questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **"Who controls the company?"** | The founder retains 100% voting control. This keeps decision-making fast and protects the vision from short-term pressures. Contributors participate in profits, not governance. If the founder mismanages, contributors can fork the open-source code. |
| **"What if profit is never declared?"** | The reinvestment reserve is formula-based (20% of TTM revenue or €50k, whichever is lower) and auditable. Quarterly P&L is shared with all participants. |
| **"12-month forfeit seems harsh. What if life happens?"** | The pause mechanism allows 6-month breaks with written notice. The intent is preventing ghost contributors, not punishing real ones. |
| **"Why is cash 4x but time 2x?"** | Cash is immediate risk with no guaranteed return. But the commitment tier bumps time to 2.5x for sustained contributors (20+ hrs/week for 6+ months). |
| **"What happens if the company is sold?"** | Exit conversion clause: outstanding point balances convert to cash from transaction proceeds before founder distribution. |
| **"How is this different from being a contractor?"** | Contractors get paid fixed rates regardless of business performance. This model gives you upside—the more profitable the business, the larger your quarterly distributions. You're trading guaranteed payment for profit participation. |

## Pitch in One Paragraph

> "We share 40% of profits quarterly with everyone who contributes. Your share is tracked in a public spreadsheet using a points system. The moment we're profitable, you start getting checks—no exit required. The code is open-source, so if we ever mismanage the business, you can fork it and compete. You're a co-founder of the product's success without the lottery-ticket waiting game."
