# 22Minds: The Movement - Strategic Roadmap (v4)

This document outlines an aggressive, multi-phase launch plan focused on **verifying value** before scaling technology. The Inguro wind-down is a background administrative task that will proceed in parallel.

---

## Phase 1: The 3-Week Launch Sprint

**Objective:** To move from a theoretical idea to a live, public movement with tangible assets, an engaged founding community, and initial proof of concept.

### Week 1 (The First 3-4 Days): The "Warm Start" Sequence
*   **Day 1: Build the "Pledge MVP" (The Unified Site):**
    *   **Tool Stack:** Carrd (Landing Page) + Airtable (Form & Database).
    *   **Domain Strategy:** Buy ONE movement-focused domain (e.g., `claritypledge.com`).
    *   **Content Architecture:**
        *   **Page 1 (Home):** The Manifesto & Pledge Form.
        *   **Page 2 (Community):** The "Clarity Dojo" info and Signer Gallery.
        *   **Page 3 (Services):** A simple "Work with Vyacheslav" tab. (Note: Move this to a personal domain in Phase 2).
    *   **Assets:** Create a downloadable **Pledge Signature Badge** for new signatories to share.
    *   **Goal:** One URL that hosts the movement and your professional offering for speed.
*   **Day 2: Activate the "Warm 20" (The Social Proof):**
    *   **Action:** Send the Pledge MVP link privately to your 15-20 warm leads.
    *   **Script:** "The pledge is live. You said you were in. Be a Founding Signatory before I go public."
    *   **Goal:** Get 15+ names visible on the list *before* sharing it widely.
*   **Day 3: Publish the Manifesto (The "Why"):**
    *   **Action:** Publish v.4 on Substack/Ghost, linking directly to the *already populated* Pledge page.
*   **Day 4: Announce the Event (The Spark):**
    *   **Action:** Create an event page for the Chiang Mai/Bremen events.
    *   **Message:** "We are live. 15 people have already pledged. Join us."

### Week 2: First Ripple & Activation
*   **Host the Founding Events (The Spark):**
    *   **Chiang Mai:** Facilitate the "Alignment Gap" experience live.
    *   **Bremen University:** Position the project as research and recruit testers.
    *   **Goal:** Move attendees from "Interested" -> "Pledged."
*   **Launch the "Founding Dojo" (The Habit & Incubator):**
    *   **Action:** Host the first 60-minute Zoom call for your "Warm 20" and new event attendees.
    *   **First Activity:** Launch the **"My Clarity Tax Story"** weekly thread to build immediate shared context.
    *   **Purpose:** Solidify the community immediately and begin training the first wave of Clarity Champions. This is the practice ground.
*   **Create Content:** Record the first Dojo session (with permission) or interview a Founding Pledger for the podcast.

### Week 3: The Engine (Routine & Expansion)
*   **Establish the Rhythm:** Lock in the weekly "Founding Dojo" time. This consistency is the heartbeat of the movement's core.
*   **Publish First Podcast:** Release the "Stories from the Alignment Gap" episode recorded in Week 2.
*   **Recruit Advisors:** Reach out to potential advisors. You now have data: "We have X pledges and Y active attendees."
*   **Document the Toolkit:** Create the "Clarity Toolkit" PDF for the "Testers" (Bucket B) acquired at the university talk.

**Milestone for Go/No-Go:** By the end of Week 3, you must have:
1.  The Manifesto published.
2.  The Pledge MVP live with 20+ signatures.
3.  The first "Founding Dojo" session completed with 5+ attendees.

## Phase 2: The Engine of Sustainability (Weeks 4 - Month 3)

**Objective:** To convert initial momentum into a sustainable revenue model and a scalable, decentralized content engine.

### Key Initiatives
*   **Scale the "Founding Dojo":** Use social media and the podcast to drive traffic to the Manifesto -> Pledge -> Founding Dojo funnel, attracting potential leaders.
*   **Develop the "Dojo Starter Kit":** Create a playbook, templates, and guides that empower any pledger to start their own Clarity Dojo in their company, community, or team. This is the key to scalable impact.
    *   **Core Components:**
        *   **The "Clarity Champion" Program:** A lightweight guide on how to facilitate and lead a practice group.
        *   **The Open-Source "Clarity Meeting" Protocol:** A simple, shareable framework for running alignment check-ins.
        *   **Assets:** Printable pledge cards, discussion prompts, and branding materials.
*   **Segment the Community:**
    *   **Bucket A (Pledgers / Champions):** Nurture this core group within the Founding Dojo to become the first wave of Clarity Champions and independent Dojo leaders.
    *   **Bucket B (Testers):** Send "Clarity Toolkit" (PDFs, checklists) to help them use it in their specific projects, creating case studies.
*   **Validate Corporate Demand:** Use the interest from your content and the university presentation to secure your first paid workshop or training session.
    *   **Offer:** "Pilot Program" for organizations (paid or low-bono for data).
*   **Build "Gating Tool MVP" (Conditional):** Only proceed if specific demand arises from the corporate pilots. Do not build in a vacuum.

### Revenue Streams (To be validated)
1.  **Primary: 1-on-1 Clarity Coaching.** Priced based on validated demand from the Dojo community.
2.  **Secondary: Corporate Workshops/Trainings.** "Pilot Programs" to install the Clarity Principle in teams.
3.  **Expansion:** Certification for other coaches (Long term).

**Milestone for Go/No-Go:** By the end of Month 3, you must have a validated path to covering your personal living expenses through coaching or workshops.

## Phase 3 & Long-Term Vision (Remains the same)

The goal is a thriving, decentralized ecosystem where:
*   **1% of the global population** has taken the Clarity Commitment.
*   **The world's most critical meetings** are optionally "gated" with the Clarity Protocol.
*   A global network of certified "Clarity Champions" and coaches exists.
*   A financially independent organization (The Clarity Commons) acts as the keeper of the standard and funds ongoing research and development.
