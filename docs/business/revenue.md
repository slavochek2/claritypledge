# Revenue Model: The Engine for the Movement

This document outlines the business model designed to financially sustain the Clarity Pledge movement.

## Philosophy: Product-Generated Revenue

The revenue model shifted from founder-as-consultant to **user-generated revenue through product value**. The protocol creates measurable outcomes; users and organizations pay for access to those outcomes.

| Old Model (Deprecated) | New Model |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Founder sells audits | Product sells itself |
| Retainer clients fund movement | Network effects fund growth |
| Bottleneck: founder's time | Bottleneck: product-market fit |

**Why the shift:** Consulting doesn't scale. A protocol that enforces understanding — and produces quantified outcomes — does.

## The Value Stack

| Output | Who Values It | Willingness to Pay |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Experience of being understood | Individual (non-pledger) | Low (entry point) |
| Calibration scores over time | Individual (pledger) | Medium |
| Verified relationship graph | Professionals, coaches | Medium-High |
| Quantified team understanding metrics | Enterprise L&D, HR | High |
| Documented conversation artifacts | Mediators, therapists | High |

**Key insight:** The *experience* is consumer. The *money* is B2B.

## Revenue Phases

### Phase 1: Validation (Current)

**Goal:** Prove the protocol works without a human facilitator.

| Activity | Revenue |
|----------|---------|
| Manual protocol tests | $0 |
| Early adopter pledgers | $0 |
| Waitlist for live protocol | $0 |

**Success metric:** Two people reach 10/10 understanding using only the app.

### Phase 2: Early Monetization

**Goal:** Per-session revenue from power users.

| Model | Price Point | Target User |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Per protocol session | $5-15/session | Coaches, facilitators |
| Monthly pro tier | $20-50/month | Active pledgers (10+ conversations/month) |

**Success metric:** 100 paying users, 80% retention.

### Phase 3: Enterprise

**Goal:** Organization-level contracts.

| Model | Price Point | Target Buyer |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Team license | $500-2000/month | L&D departments |
| Enterprise (unlimited) | Custom | HR, Org Development |
| API/White-label | Revenue share | Coaching platforms, therapy apps |

**Success metric:** 3 enterprise contracts, ARR > $50k.

## The Moat (What Makes This Defensible)

| Moat Component | How It Compounds |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Calibration history** | Your accuracy scores across 100+ conversations = portable identity |
| **Verified relationship graph** | Who you've reached understanding with, cross-organization |
| **Protocol as standard** | Others build on it; forks are disconnected islands |
| **Network density** | Value increases with each new participant |

**Open source risk mitigation:** The code can be forked. The network cannot. Value lives in the connections, not the codebase.

---

## Deprecated: Consulting Model

The following approaches were explored and set aside:

| Approach | Why Deprecated |
|----------|----------------|
| Cognitive Clarity Audit ($400) | Doesn't scale; founder is bottleneck |
| Retainer clients | Same scaling problem |
| "Fundraising as activism" framing | Still valid for messaging, not for business model |

These may return as premium services later, but they are not the core revenue engine.

## Open Questions

| Question | Impact on Revenue |
|----------|-------------------|
| What's the conversion rate from free pledge to paid protocol? | Determines Phase 2 viability |
| Will enterprises pay for "understanding metrics"? | Determines Phase 3 ceiling |
| Can coaches charge clients for protocol-mediated sessions? | Creates indirect revenue channel |
| What's minimum network density for lock-in? | Determines when growth becomes self-sustaining |

## Next Steps

1. **Validate protocol without facilitator** — manual test with real disagreement
2. **Interview 3 potential B2B buyers** — L&D leaders, mediators, coaches
3. **Define MVP pricing experiment** — what would early adopters pay?
4. **Build waitlist** — gauge demand before building billing infrastructure
