# Why Transparency Matters

A short note on why we built accountability into our model.

## The Structural Problem with Limited Companies

Limited liability is a feature of modern corporations—shareholders can only lose what they invest, not their personal assets. This is useful for encouraging entrepreneurship, but it creates a side effect:

**When downside is capped, there's incentive to externalize costs.**

The math is simple:
- Profits go to shareholders
- If something goes wrong (environmental damage, unpaid debts, worker harm), the company can declare bankruptcy
- Losses beyond the company's assets get absorbed by creditors, workers, communities, or taxpayers

This isn't a conspiracy—it's a structural incentive built into the legal form. Economists call it "moral hazard from limited liability."

## How This Shows Up

| Pattern | What happens |
|---------|--------------|
| **Underinvestment in safety** | Cutting corners is profitable until an accident; if accident costs exceed company assets, shareholders walk away |
| **Environmental shortcuts** | Pollute now, collect profits, dissolve company before cleanup costs arrive |
| **Subcontracting chains** | Main company contracts to shell entities that cut corners; main company stays shielded |
| **Minimal asset structures** | Operate "judgment-proof" by keeping assets in separate entities |

None of this requires bad intent. The structure rewards these behaviors.

## Why We Built Accountability In

Our company is a limited liability entity (Estonian OÜ). We can't change that structural reality. But we can add mechanisms that create accountability where the legal form doesn't:

### 1. Transparent Financials
Quarterly P&L shared with all contributors. You can see where money goes.

### 2. Open-Source Code
If the business is mismanaged, contributors can fork the code and compete. This creates reputational and practical consequences for bad behavior that bankruptcy would otherwise shield.

### 3. Visible Contribution Ledger
Everyone sees everyone's points, including the founder's. No hidden allocations.

### 4. Formula-Based Reserves
The reinvestment threshold is a formula, not discretion. It's auditable.

## The Point

Limited liability is a tool. Like any tool, it can be used well or poorly.

We chose to pair it with transparency and open-source because:
- Accountability shouldn't depend solely on legal structures
- People who contribute deserve to verify, not just trust
- The fork option creates consequences that bankruptcy doesn't erase

This isn't about being virtuous. It's about building a system where good behavior is the rational choice—even when the legal form doesn't require it.
