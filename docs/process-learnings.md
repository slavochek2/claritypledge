## An objection is a conjecture, not a refutation — pre-commit the falsifier before the conversation

**Date:** 2026-07-27
**Status:** proposed

In a single 2026-07-26 conversation the buyer moved four times — co-founder pairs → a COO buying an interdepartmental handoff protocol → an acquirer in due diligence → citizens in an online assembly. Each step was a defensible answer to a real objection, and **not one objection was a test.** No pitch failed, no letter went unanswered, no founder said no. Each was a *conjecture about the market*, paid for with scope. The direction was monotone: every move raised the stakes and diffused the payer, because objections dissolve at sufficient altitude.

Secondary signature, same session: eight further messages designing a funnel (15 min or 30 · questionnaire or interview · report or session · €199 / €299 / €2k) that **changed every single message.** That instability wasn't indecision — it was the absence of a constraint. Conjecture against conjecture with zero data about what a founding pair does when asked to pay. In that condition a design *cannot* converge, because there is nothing to converge on.

This is the project's own Popper gap running in reverse: falsification requires a test, and "this might fail" is not evidence that it did.

**Fix to test — write the falsifier down *before* any conversation that could relocate the buyer, wedge, or positioning** (with an AI, an advisor, or a peer). One line, in the form:

> *I move off this only if [N attempts] produce [result].*

Then no argument in that conversation can move the position — only the number can.

**Standing pre-commitment for the current wedge `[FOUNDER DECISION: thresholds]`** — proposed defaults, drawn from the funnel walk-back in [goals.md](goals.md) (~7% book, ~20% close); overwrite with your own:
- 50 warm messages → fewer than 3 conversations booked ⇒ the message is wrong (change the message, not the segment).
- 5 free sessions run → nobody asks about anything paid ⇒ the wedge is wrong.

Until a number exists, every strategy conversation can relocate the buyer, and in the week of 2026-07-26 four did.

**Track:** over the next 4 weeks, did a written pre-commitment prevent (or correctly permit) a relocation? Once 2–3 data points exist, promote the rule to [decisions.md](decisions.md) `[process]` and remove this entry.

## Spotting the illusion of recursive understanding in the wild

**Date:** 2026-05-19
**Status:** proposed

When the founder spots the illusion in an unscheduled context (casual conversation, business meeting, family setting), in-the-moment correction often triggers the defensive response that the workshop frame is designed to prevent. Opt-in is what makes the framework safe in workshops; reactive deployment loses opt-in by default.

**Open default to test:** notice early → pause (do not correct mid-conversation) → if the relationship has standing, ask permission for an async follow-up ("I noticed something about how we just talked — want me to send a short note?") → send the artifact (letter excerpt, paraphrase, story) async with the reader's consent → only verify in /live if they engage.

**Fix:** Test this default in 3 unscheduled-context encounters over the next 4 weeks. Track: did pausing-then-asking-permission produce a different outcome than in-the-moment correction? Once 3 data points exist, promote the better-performing default to facilitator-guide.md and remove this entry.

**Data point 1 of 3 (2026-07-16) — the anti-default was run, and it went the way this entry predicts.** Unscheduled social context, recent acquaintance, no stakes and no opt-in. The protocol was deployed *in the moment and unannounced*: "I understand you at 5/10," plus a request that she grade his understanding of her. She declined to give a number, then said she didn't want to think right now; that self-report was overridden ("how can you talk without thinking"), and she disengaged entirely.

This is **not** a test of the pause-then-ask default — it is a control observation of the reactive branch, and it reproduces the predicted failure. Three things it adds beyond confirming the hazard:
1. **The protocol has no consent layer and no ambient-context guard** — neither is written down anywhere in `docs/`. The distinguishing rule (why running this unannounced on a close friend at dinner is a different act) does not exist. That rule is the missing artifact, not the encounter.
2. **The self-report sovereignty gap fired live, in the observer's favour** — a first-person report about her own cognitive state was overridden by the observer's model of it, by the person who named the gap. This is the framework's open axiom being resolved unremarked, against the framework's own commitment.
3. **A score being available does not imply the gap is articulable.** Giving a number is cheap; articulating the delta to 10 is expensive theory-of-mind work — same operation, opposite valence (reward for the asker, tax for the other party). Candidate design fix, untested: the burden of articulating the gap belongs to the party who wants the comprehension — the asker produces the candidate delta, the other party only says warmer or colder.

**Guard on the interpretation:** "it's probably just how I said it" is unfalsifiable — every refusal becomes a delivery bug and the trait explanation can never lose. Do not settle this by introspection. The falsifier is the asymmetric variant run on ~10 strangers with stated stakes: refusal persists → trait boundary; refusal dissolves → delivery. Not yet run.

## Default to e2e test for verification — never delegate manual testing to user

**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Status:** proposed

Agent asked user to manually test /live session flow 4+ times instead of writing an e2e test. Playwright two-party infrastructure exists (`e2e/helpers/test-user.ts`, `test-realtime.ts`) and can reproduce any session scenario. When writing a reproducer, extract exact conditions from screenshots/bug reports — don't assume the happy path (this session: the bug was same-name users, but the first e2e test used different names and got a false green).

**Fix:** (A) When investigating a /live bug, write the e2e reproducer FIRST before theorizing. (B) Always extract the exact user conditions from evidence (screenshot names, console output) into test parameters. (C) After CSS changes on /live, run `npx playwright test e2e/live-rating-drawer.spec.ts` before reporting success.

## /dev pre-flight doesn't check branch lineage — /ship surprise risk

**Friction:** Ran `/dev` while on `p422-p425-uat` (40+ commits ahead of main). `/dev` silently branched from it. After implementation + `/verify` pass, user asked about `/ship` — and only then discovered it would ship all 40+ commits, not just the new work. Fix was written to `dev.md` (warn when > 5 commits ahead of main, offer A/B/C) but the file was reverted before the session ended.

**Proposed fix:** Re-apply the branch lineage check to `/dev` pre-flight step 0:
- Run `git rev-list --count main..HEAD` before branching
- If > 5 commits ahead: stop, explain, offer A) branch from main / B) cherry-pick after / C) proceed knowingly
- Add same check to `/pick-flow` scope scoring table

**Status:** proposed

## Dead code not caught by /finish or pre-commit

**Date:** 2026-03-02
**Status:** proposed

`PointCardDetail.tsx` had zero production callers and lived in `src/app/components/` undetected — caught only by an ad-hoc consistency audit, not by `/finish` or any automated check. `/finish` checks correctness and patterns; it does not detect zero-caller exports.

**Fix:** Add dead-code detection (`knip` or `ts-prune`) to `scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh` or as a step in `/maintain:cleanup`. Zero-caller components accumulate silently across feature merges.

## Raw ideas processing has no skill (`/process-raw-ideas`)

**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Status:** proposed

Two separate sessions involved processing voice notes into structured product/philosophical content (extract ideas → classify → file spec / doc update / private content). Each session reinvented the intake flow with no template: what gets filed where, what stays private, what becomes a spec vs doc update.

**Fix:** Create `/process-raw-ideas` skill. Steps: (1) read raw transcript, (2) extract distinct ideas, (3) classify each: spec / doc update / private / drop, (4) file or draft in the right place, (5) surface open questions and dropped threads. Should handle the "some content is private, some public" split explicitly.

## Mobile UX bugs are session-killers

**Date:** 2026-03-14
**Status:** proposed

Observed during Pair C session. Three bugs that break the session flow:
1. **Scroll bounce → accidental refresh:** On mobile, scrolling up causes the page to refresh, kicking the user out of the active /live session. Session state lost.
2. **Tap targets too small:** Users with long nails miss the intended button and accidentally hit "speak freely" instead. Not clear what mode they're in afterward.
3. **Position removal on click unclear:** Clicking on an already-taken position removes it, but there's no visual feedback or confirmation. Users don't realize they've un-positioned.

**Fix:** These should be fixed before the next facilitated session — each one causes visible confusion and breaks the experience for channel partners evaluating the tool.

## Synchronous sales calls as acquisition bottleneck

**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** proposed

Intro calls that don't directly deliver session value get deprioritized under bandwidth constraints. Fix: default to async distribution (booking links, forwardable offers) instead of scheduling exploratory calls. Batch scheduled calls into one day/week.
