## About the Founder

Before the Clarity Pledge, I spent years in B2B sales and as a founder: raising over $392k for a SaaS startup, parting ways with multiple co‑founders, and coaching teams on how to close deals instead of just talk about them. Again and again, the most expensive mistakes came from misalignment, vague promises, and conversations where everyone nodded but nobody meant the same thing.

But for me, this wasn't just a business problem. It was personal. As a 'Third Culture Kid'—from a country that no longer exists (USSR), raised in another (Germany)—I never had the luxury of assumed understanding. Combined with being neurodivergent, I was wired to need explicit communication to function, while the corporate world seemed to thrive on strategic ambiguity.

This created a constant, painful friction I now call **Intellectual Moral Injury**: the deep dissonance of being forced to pretend that nonsense makes sense to protect a paycheck. I watched good people burn out, trapped in collective hallucinations, and realized the cost of ambiguity wasn't just financial, it was human.

The Clarity Pledge started as my survival mechanism. It was a practical fix. I began documenting every painful mistake—around hiring, partners, and trust—and turning them into simple, testable rules. Influenced by tools like Ray Dalio’s *Principles*, I refined pages of notes into the core commitments that now form the pledge.

If you’ve ever felt that physical flinch of nodding along to a lie, or paid a high price for miscommunication in sales, hiring, or co‑founder decisions, this was built for you. It's for anyone who cares more about what is *true* than what is polite. Welcome.
