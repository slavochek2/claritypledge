# P14: Social Accounts Integration

## Summary
Allow users to sign up with any famous social media account (not just LinkedIn) and display their social handles on their pledge certificate. Support multiple social accounts per user while keeping the UX super simple.

## Problem Statement
Currently, when someone signs the Understanding Pledge, they're somewhat anonymous to visitors. A LinkedIn URL tucked away doesn't effectively show who this person is in the digital world. Users want to showcase their presence across multiple platforms where they practice clear communication.

## User Story
*Imagine Maya, a product designer who's active on Twitter/X, has a portfolio on Dribbble, shares code on GitHub, and has LinkedIn for corporate networking. When she signs the pledge, she wants people to see her - all the places where she practices what she preaches about clear communication.*

## Key Questions to Resolve

### 1. Sign-up Flow - How do we keep it dead simple?
- Do users *authenticate* with social (OAuth) or just *add* their handles manually?
- OAuth = verified but complex
- Manual entry = simple but unverified

### 2. Which Platforms?
Potential platforms to support:
- LinkedIn
- Twitter/X
- GitHub
- Instagram
- YouTube
- Dribbble
- Behance
- Medium
- Personal website/portfolio

Decision needed: Curated list vs. allow any platform?

### 3. Display on Pledge Certificate
Visual challenges to solve:
- Social icons in a row? Could get cluttered with 5+ accounts
- Primary handle featured, others collapsed?
- Mobile view considerations

### 4. Verification
- Do we care if handles are real?
- Unverified handles could be faked (trust issue)
- OAuth verification adds friction but adds credibility

### 5. Data Model
- Multiple accounts per user = new table relationship
- What happens to existing LinkedIn URLs? Migration path needed

## Open Questions for Planning

1. **Authentication vs. Display** - Sign in with social accounts (OAuth) or just add handles manually?
2. **Account Limit** - Cap at max 5 or unlimited? More accounts = more clutter risk
3. **Primary Account** - Should one be designated as "primary" and featured prominently?
4. **Migration** - How to handle users who already have LinkedIn URLs?

## Status
Parked for future consideration.
