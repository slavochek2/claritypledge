Title: The Epistemic Turn in Constructor Theory: From Individual Knowledge to [[012 shared understanding]]  
1. Introduction  
Constructor theory, originally proposed by David Deutsch and developed further by Chiara Marletto, reimagines physics in terms of which transformations are possible and which are impossible, rather than describing how things evolve over time. Within this framework, knowledge is not simply an abstract mental phenomenon but a physical, embodied entity: information that, once instantiated, reliably causes transformations while tending to remain instantiated. This view has profound implications not only for physics and computation but for epistemology—the theory of knowledge itself.  
Yet despite this powerful reframing, constructor theory has, thus far, treated knowledge primarily as something individually instantiated: something a single constructor (such as a human or an AI) holds and uses to enact transformations. It has not fully addressed what it means to share knowledge, or how understanding is constructed between minds.  
This paper proposes a critical extension: that [[012 shared understanding]] itself is a constructor-theoretic task. The transformation from fragmented or private mental models into a robust, falsifiable, hard-to-vary explanatory framework held across multiple minds requires specific cognitive constructors. We call this shift the epistemic turn in constructor theory. It allows us to describe the co-construction of [[012 shared understanding]] as a task, define the constructors capable of enacting it, and suggest how such transformations can be tested, measured, and improved.  
2. Constructor Theory and the Nature of Knowledge  
Constructor theory defines knowledge as information that is not only instantiated in a physical substrate but also capable of causing its own reliable reproduction. A recipe, a genetic code, or a scientific law encoded in human minds can all serve as examples of knowledge in this sense.  
In this framework, the constructor is an entity or system that enacts a transformation without being consumed—such as a human mind applying a theory, or a factory robot executing a design.  
Deutsch further posits that the human mind, via language, criticism, and explanation, is the only known universal constructor—a system capable, in principle, of enacting any physically possible transformation, given the right knowledge.  
However, while this provides a rich foundation for understanding the growth of individual knowledge, it leaves underexplored a key question: how is knowledge truly shared?  
3. [[012 shared understanding]] as a Constructor-Theoretic Task  
We propose that the formation of [[012 shared understanding]] is itself a well-posed task within constructor theory. Formally, the task is:  
> Transform multiple, fragmented or private mental models into a shared, falsifiable, hard-to-vary explanatory framework.  
  
  
This is a non-trivial transformation. It involves aligning semantics, resolving contradictions, surfacing implicit assumptions, and ensuring mutual testability. It is not reducible to "transmission" of data; it requires mutual transformation of mental models.  
In constructor-theoretic terms, such a transformation is possible only if suitable constructors exist. These constructors must not only present explanations but interact dialogically, respond to challenge, and adapt without being epistemically corrupted.  
4. Epistemic Constructors and the Architecture of Shared Knowledge  
We define five cognitive constructors necessary for [[012 shared understanding]]:  
1. Embrace Challenges – Openness to disagreement and curiosity about error.  
  
2. Listen Actively – Accurately absorbing and interpreting others' meanings.  
  
3. Think Critically – Applying falsifiability and logic to assess claims.  
  
4. Explore Creatively – Considering alternatives and edge cases.  
  
5. Speak Honestly – Expressing beliefs clearly, including uncertainties.  
  
  
Each of these behaviors enables reliable transformations of epistemic states without being exhausted. They are the cognitive equivalents of physical constructors.  
We further propose a trust-preserving protocol (Please/Thank You/Sorry, or PTS) that acts as a social lubricant—ensuring that the epistemic constructors can function even in socially delicate or adversarial contexts.  
AI systems—particularly interactive, explanation-guided models ("idea-AIs")—can be designed to host, express, and refine ideas through dialogue, functioning as epistemic constructors. These systems could engage users in structured dialogue that seeks not just agreement, but verified epistemic transformation.  
5. Measuring Epistemic Transformation  
How do we know when [[012 shared understanding]] has occurred? The transformation is successful if, and only if, the agents involved can:  
Explain the idea clearly.  
Apply it in new contexts.  
Critique it meaningfully.  
Survive challenges without reverting to misunderstanding.  
  
The "health" of an idea, then, is a function of how reliably it can cause this transformation across diverse minds. This makes [[012 shared understanding]] a testable, measurable output—not just a philosophical ideal.  
6. Comparison with Deutsch's Constructor Theory  
Deutsch and Marletto focus primarily on the instantiation of knowledge within individual constructors. The emphasis is on how knowledge is created and preserved in physical systems.  
Our contribution complements and extends their work:  
By identifying [[012 shared understanding]] as a distinct task.  
By defining multi-agent epistemic constructors.  
By focusing on transformations between minds, not just within one.  
By offering measurement protocols for epistemic transformation.  
  
This is not a contradiction of Deutsch's vision but a natural elaboration—one that moves constructor theory into the realm of social epistemology and cognitive systems design.  
7. Implications and Applications  
Understanding [[012 shared understanding]] as a physical task has powerful implications:  
Education: Shift from transmission to transformation as a teaching goal.  
Science communication: Emphasize testable convergence, not rhetorical persuasion.  
AI development: Build systems whose purpose is not to answer, but to cause understanding.  
Problem-solving: Foster shared epistemic frames to address global challenges.  
  
Constructor theory thus becomes not only a foundation for physics but a scaffold for designing epistemic infrastructures: systems where knowledge can be reliably made mutual.  
8. Conclusion  
We have argued that [[012 shared understanding]] is not a byproduct of communication, but a physically possible task in its own right—one that requires specific constructors, can succeed or fail, and can be measured.  
This reframing opens new avenues for research in AI, education, and collective intelligence. It invites us to view epistemic convergence not as a mystery or coincidence, but as a process we can understand, improve, and design for.  
The epistemic turn in constructor theory, then, is both a theoretical expansion and a practical necessity: in an era where [[012 shared understanding]] is endangered, we must treat it as a task worth mastering.
