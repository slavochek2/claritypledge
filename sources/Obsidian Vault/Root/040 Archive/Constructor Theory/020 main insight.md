> We define "[[011 Epistemic Integrity]]" as an explanation's capacity to remain falsifiable, coherent, and recursively teachable across multiple minds that share or can adopt minimal bridging axioms. This ensures knowledge can scale to collaborative problem-solving while preserving its critical structure. If attempts to replicate the explanation consistently fail—even among minds prepared with adequate prerequisites—then the explanation lacks integrity. But each such failure highlights missing bridges or flawed premises, thereby making the process [[antifragility|antifragile]]: every breakdown in transmission yields insights that either refine the explanation or reveal unbridgeable axiomatic gaps. In this way, robust knowledge evolves not merely by spreading, but by surviving repeated critical reconstruction among diverse minds.

Hard to Vary: Remove "falsifiability," and you lose the testable aspect. Remove "recursive teachability," and you can't measure integrity across minds.

  

  

> We define "[[011 Epistemic Integrity]]" as an explanation's capacity to remain falsifiable, coherent, and recursively teachable across minds, provided minimal bridging axioms can be established. "[[012 shared understanding]]" is the social manifestation of this integrity—when multiple minds reliably reconstruct the same explanation for problem-solving. A "[[universal epistemic constructor]]" not only generates explanations for any domain, but also ensures others gain that generative power, bridging axioms or assumptions as needed. If an explanation consistently fails to replicate across minds that have adequate bridging, it lacks epistemic integrity. Each failure, however, highlights missing premises or flawed logic, thus making the system [[antifragility|antifragile]]: every breakdown in transmission drives refinement, bridging, or axiom negotiation, enabling deeper, more robust forms of knowledge.

  

  

Final Note:

Your main conceptual triad is:

1. [[011 Epistemic Integrity]] (explanation-level property)
2. [[012 shared understanding]] (group-level result)
3. [[universal epistemic constructor]] (agent-level capacity)

  

They interlock:

Without integrity, shared understanding quickly degrades.

- Without bridging, universal constructor attempts fail.
- Without shared understanding, we can't confirm integrity on group problems.

  

  

[[011 Epistemic Integrity]]: the explanation-level property-if it is tested under replication, it remains coherent and falsifiable.

b. [[012 shared understanding]]: the group-level outcome-multiple minds actually hold the same explanation.

So one is a latent property (explanation's potential to survive transmission), the other is an observed phenomenon (it actually survived in a real group). They inform each other but are not identical definitions.

  

[[011 Epistemic Integrity]] is: the capacity to remain falsifiable, coherent, recursively teachable.

- [[012 shared understanding]] is: the actual manifestation of knowledge replication in a group with that capacity tested.

  

> A "[[universal epistemic constructor]]" is a system that not only generates robust, falsifiable explanations but also transforms other minds into capable explainers themselves, through bridging axioms and error-correction. We call an explanation "epistemically integral" if it remains coherent and testable under repeated replication across biased minds that share minimal logical assumptions. When this capacity is successfully exercised in a group, it yields [[012 shared understanding]]—an observable phenomenon where each participant can reconstruct and teach the explanation. If repeated attempts fail, either bridging is insufficient or the explanation lacks true integrity, creating an [[antifragility|antifragile]] feedback loop: every failure prompts refinement of either the explanation or the bridging approach, thus driving knowledge to become more universally transmissible.
