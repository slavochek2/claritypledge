-- diffed against: 20260605150000_p878_search_profiles_rpc.sql (section 6a)
-- P898: seal_and_send_letter carries point_config.lead_count into the snapshot
-- AND excludes superseded points from new snapshots.
--
-- lead_count: the seal RPC builds the snapshot's point_config with an explicit
-- jsonb_build_object — fields not listed there are silently dropped (the P819
-- imageUrl incident). Without this migration an author's lead_count vanishes
-- at seal and the reader's fallback-to-1 makes the bug invisible.
--
-- Validation on seal: only a JSON number is carried (floored, never negative).
-- Anything else (absent, string, null) seals as 1 — the historical implicit
-- single lead. The upper bound is clamped on READ against the visible point
-- count (getEffectiveLeadCount), because hidden-point filtering happens there.
--
-- superseded_by IS NULL filter: compose shows only current heads (P800 filter
-- in docs-service), so the author can neither see nor hide superseded points —
-- but the seal RPC copied ALL story_points into the snapshot. They tail after
-- `order` (unlisted) and surface as post-story points the author never saw.
-- Seal-visibility now matches compose-visibility (the P749 parity lesson).
-- Already-sealed letters are NOT repaired — P843: a sealed letter freezes the
-- point set at delivery time; this filter applies to NEW seals only.
--
-- Identical to the P878 body EXCEPT the added 'lead_count' key and the
-- superseded filter in the snapshot INSERT's points subquery. Signature
-- unchanged (UUID, JSONB, JSONB) — replaces in place. Idempotent: CREATE OR REPLACE.
