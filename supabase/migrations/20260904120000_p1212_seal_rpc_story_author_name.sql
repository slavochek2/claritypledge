-- diffed against: 20260903164500_p1212_seal_rpc_story_author.sql
-- P1212 §4b (second pass): the snapshot carries the story author's NAME, not only the id.
--
-- WHY A SECOND MIGRATION. 20260903164500 sealed 'storyAuthorId' so the letter surface could
-- tell a machine-authored reading from a human's. It could -- and then printed the wrong name
-- beside it. snapshotToStoryWithPoints takes the id from the snapshot and the NAME from its
-- 'author' argument, which story-walk.tsx:97 fills with the letter's SENDER. So a sealed
-- agent story rendered the byline "Agent on {sender}" and the footer "a machine account wrote
-- this reading of {sender}" -- machine-written prose attributed to a named human, which the
-- previous migration's own header calls the one outcome this surface must never produce.
--
-- Found by adversarial review (codex, 2026-09-04) by RENDERING the component. Four test files
-- and 484 assertions passed over it, and one assertion written the same day actively locked it
-- in: expect(story.authorName).toBe('Human Sender') on a story authored by 'agent-1'.
--
-- An id without its name is not an identity. Nothing client-side could close the gap: the
-- agent registry maps profile_id -> operator_name only (agent-accounts-service.ts:46), so the
-- subject's own name has no other route onto a sealed surface.
--
-- LEFT JOIN, never INNER: a deleted author must not silently drop the story from the snapshot.
-- Absent name reads as '' and the surface falls back exactly as it did before this field.
--
-- Replaces 20260903164500's body verbatim, one key and one join added. Rebuilding from an
-- older base is the regression sd-guard-completeness.test.ts exists to catch, and this
-- function has suffered it three times (P952, P749/P757, P833).
--
-- No backfill. Letters sealed before this carry no storyAuthorName; absent is correct, and a
-- guess from the sender's name is the defect being fixed.
